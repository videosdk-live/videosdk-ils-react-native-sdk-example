## 🧠 Key Concepts

Understand the core components of our SDK:

- `Meeting` - A Meeting represents Real-time audio and video communication.

  **` Note: Don't confuse the terms Room and Meeting; both mean the same thing 😃`**

- `Sessions` - A particular duration you spend in a given meeting is referred as a session, you can have multiple sessions of a specific meetingId.
- `Participant` - A participant refers to anyone attending the meeting session. The `local participant` represents yourself (You), while all other attendees are considered `remote participants`.
- `Stream` - A stream refers to video or audio media content that is published by either the `local participant` or `remote participants`.

## 🔐 Token Generation

The token is used to create and validate a meeting using API and also initialize a meeting.

🛠️ `Development Environment`:

- You may use a temporary token for development. To create a temporary token, go to VideoSDK's [dashboard](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys) .

🌐 `Production Environment`:

- You must set up an authentication server to authorize users for production. To set up an authentication server, please take a look at our official example repositories. [videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples](https://github.com/videosdk-live/videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples)
